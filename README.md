# Latin-declension-shapes

When I need to memorize complex morphology, such as Latin noun endings, I like to arrange the information in a table so that I can color similar cells and remember the resulting shapes. More info on my process [here](https://languagelearning.stackexchange.com/a/5507/12392).

This document shows the Latin noun declension endings with patterns highlighted. This creates color shapes unique to each of the five declensions, which I found made them easier to memorize.

The PDF can be viewed [here](https://github.com/garfieldnate/Latin-declension-shapes/releases/download/v0.01/Latin_declension_shapes.pdf). It's a rough piece of work, but I hope you may get some use from it.
