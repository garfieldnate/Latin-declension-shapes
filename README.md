# Latin-declension-shapes

When I need to memorize complex morphology, such as Latin noun endings, I like to arrange the information in a table so that I can color similar cells and remember the resulting shapes. More info on my process [here](https://languagelearning.stackexchange.com/a/5507/12392).

This document shows the Latin noun declension endings with patterns highlighted. This creates color shapes unique to each of the five declensions, which I found made them easier to memorize.
